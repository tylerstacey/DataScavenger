DataScavenger
=============

CS3715 - Temperature Records Project

This project needs Play! Framework V. 1.2.5 to be run.

To run the application change into the 'play' directory and run the command:
%play run DataScavenger

The web-app is accessible on localhost:9000.

This application has been compiled to run with Java Version 1.5 or 
greater. Running this application on a Java version greater than that on labnet will cause the application to fail. To remedy this delete the folders under 
play/DataScavenger/tmp and then run the command:
%play run DataScavenger

From the play directory again.
